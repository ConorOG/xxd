xxd - a hexdump utility by Juergen Weigert, v1.11 by Vadim Vygonets

This version is based on V1.10 27oct98 by Juergen Weigert.
Between 2000 and 2011 it accumulated patches by the Vim team and
others.  In 2013 it was pulled out of the Vim tree, had a couple
of features added and was pronounced version 1.11.
